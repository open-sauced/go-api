# OpenAPI Generator Ignore
# Generated by openapi-generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# As an example, the C# client generator defines ApiClient.cs.
# You can make changes and tell OpenAPI Generator to ignore just this file by uncommenting the following line:
#ApiClient.cs

# You can match any string of characters against a directory, file or extension with a single asterisk (*):
#foo/*/qux
# The above matches foo/bar/qux and foo/baz/qux, but not foo/bar/baz/qux

# You can recursively match patterns against a directory, file or extension with a double asterisk (**):
#foo/**/qux
# This matches foo/bar/qux, foo/baz/qux, and foo/bar/baz/qux

# You can also negate patterns with an exclamation (!).
# For example, you can ignore all files in a docs folder with the file extension .md:
#docs/*.md
# Then explicitly reverse the ignore rule for a single file:
#!docs/README.md

# These files should be ignored and are duplicates from the OpenAPI spec.
